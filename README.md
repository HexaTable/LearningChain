## About the Project

This project was developed during [BugsByte Hackathon](https://bugsbyte.cesium.di.uminho.pt/), a 48h event organized by [CeSIUM](https://cesium.di.uminho.pt/). We were awarded the __2nd place__ :medal_sports:

Our goal was to develop a web application that allows users to create, sell and buy online courses. The difference between this and other similar solutions is that we have used Web3 technologies - all the payments are made with Ether and the courses conclusion is verified using an Ethereum smart contract that generates an ERC-721 Non-Fungible Token (NFT), which is then stored in the user's wallet and can be used to prove that the user has completed the course.
